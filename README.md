### Step 3: Analyze Frequent Patterns

1. **Adjust the minimum support threshold**: Use the slider in the "Frequent Pattern Analysis" section to select a value between 0.1 and 1.0 (default is 0.3).
2. If there is enough data, a table of **frequent patterns** will display, showing itemsets with their `support` values.
3. **Top 10 Frequent Patterns Chart**:
   - The frequent patterns data will be visualized as a bar chart, helping you easily identify the most popular itemsets.
4. If no patterns meet the selected `min support`, a message will suggest trying a different value.
